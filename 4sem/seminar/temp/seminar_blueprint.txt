Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Basics of CNN Architecture: Explain the fundamental components of a CNN, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Use simple visual aids and analogies to make the concepts clear.
How CNNs Work: Describe how CNNs process images, emphasizing how convolutional layers detect features like edges, textures, and shapes. Illustrate with examples of feature maps at different layers.



Applications of CNN-Based Object Detection

Real-World Examples: Discuss practical applications of object detection in various fields such as autonomous vehicles (detecting pedestrians and other vehicles), healthcare (identifying abnormalities in medical images), and security (surveillance systems recognizing faces and objects).
Benefits and Impact: Highlight the benefits of object detection, such as improved safety in autonomous driving, enhanced diagnostic accuracy in healthcare, and increased security in surveillance systems. Use case studies or success stories to illustrate these points.
