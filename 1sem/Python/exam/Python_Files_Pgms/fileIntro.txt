A file is simply a sequence of characters stored on your computer or network. 
One of the things that makes a file different from a string or list of characters is that the file exists even after a program ends. 
This makes a file useful for maintaining information that must be remembered for a long period of time.
Within a Python program a file is represented by a value of type file. 
This value does not actually hold the contents of the file, rather the value is a portal through which the user can access the contents of the file. 
A file stored on disk might easily contain more characters then can be held by a variable in memory.
A file value is used in three distinct steps. First, the file is opened. 
This establishes the link between the file value in the Python program and the information stored on the disk.
Next, values are read or written to the file. 
The process involves bringing characters in from the disk and storing them in a string in the Python program, or alternatively taking the contents of a string in your program and writing them out to the disk. 
When all values have been either read or written, the last step is to close the file.
